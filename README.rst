About
-----
**Agrogeophy-data is part of the agrogeophysical catalog website:** `<http://geo.geoscienze.unipd.it/growingwebsite/map_catalog>`__ 

What can you find?
******************
- Some guidance as to how to prepare a dataset for the catalog (workflow and a JSON-formatted metadata.txt file following metadata standards);
- Thematic agrogeophysical datasets packaged with:
    - associated metadata (biotic, abiotic, survey, quality assessement, ...)
    - when applicable a journal metadata files (*.jnl)  produced using REDA (https://github.com/geophysics-ubonn/reda)

What won't you find here?
*************************
At this point we do not provide user a data storage facility. 

Project goals
-------------
Propose improvement for the *Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse* of agrogeophysical datasets

How it works?
-------------
- *Findability* and *Accessibility*: the agrogeophy-catalog website is a user friendly interface to search for dataset via keywords/geolocalisation/...
- *Interoperability*: agrogeophy-data package is intimately linked to REDA package. REDA serves as a translation service, converting old formats to new ones when necessary especially for IP/SIP data.
- *Reuse*: a link to a dataset repository will allow to download the full dataset and a complete list of metadata describing the dataset to retrieve it.
