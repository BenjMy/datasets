About
-----
**Agrogeophy-data is part of the agrogeophysical catalog website:** `<http://geo.geoscienze.unipd.it/growingwebsite/map_catalog>`__ 

What can you find?
******************
- A list of agrogeophysical datasets references
- When applicable journal metadata files (*.jnl) are produced using REDA (https://github.com/geophysics-ubonn/reda) and returned to the agrogeophysical catalog database.

What won't you find here?
*************************
At this point we do not provide user a data storage facility. 

Project goals
-------------
Propose improvement for the *Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse* of agrogeophysical datasets

How it works?
-------------
- *Findability* and *Accessibility*: the agrogeophy-catalog website is a user friendly interface to search for dataset via keywords/geolocalisation/...
- *Interoperability*: agrogeophy-data package is intimately linked to REDA package. REDA serves as a translation service, converting old formats to new ones when necessary especially for IP/SIP data.
- *Reuse*: A link to a dataset repository will allow to download the full dataset and a complete list of metadata describing the dataset to retrieve it.
