About
-----
**Agrogeophy-data** is part of the [agrogeophysical catalog website](https://agrogeophy.github.io/catalog) 

Project goals
-------------
Propose improvement for the *Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse* of agrogeophysical datasets


What can you find?

- Some guidance as to how to prepare a dataset for the catalog (workflow and a JSON-formatted metadata.txt file following our metadata standards);

Instruction to [prepare a agrogeophysical dataset](https://agrogeophy.github.io/datasets/data-management.html#workflow-for-preparing-dataset)

- Thematic agrogeophysical datasets packaged with associated metadata (biotic, abiotic, survey, quality assessement, ...)

What won't you find here? At this point we do not provide user a data storage facility. 


## Thematic apps 

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\rho&space;=&space;f&space;(\theta)" title="\rho = f (\theta)" /> [![Pedophysical data app](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://share.streamlit.io/benjmy/ert_swc_board/main/app.py)


## How it works?
- *Findability* and *Accessibility*: the agrogeophy-catalog website is a user friendly interface to search for dataset via keywords/geolocalisation/...
- *Reuse*: a link to a dataset repository will allow to download the full dataset and a complete list of metadata describing the dataset to retrieve it.
